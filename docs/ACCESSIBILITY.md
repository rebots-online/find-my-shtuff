## Accessibility and Responsiveness

Ensuring the application is accessible to all users and responsive across various devices is a critical part of a production release.

This section serves as a placeholder and reminder for performing a thorough manual review and implementing necessary improvements.

Key areas to check during the review include (but are not limited to):
*   Keyboard navigation
*   Screen reader compatibility (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)
*   Color contrast
*   Text zoom and reflow
*   Responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
*   Focus indicators

Consider using tools like Lighthouse, Axe, or browser developer tools for initial checks.

Further improvements and testing will be tracked as separate issues.
