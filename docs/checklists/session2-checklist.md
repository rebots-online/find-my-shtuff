# Session 2 â€“ Production Readiness Checklist

During this session the following steps were taken to ensure the project builds successfully and passes TypeScript checks.

- Added `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` as development dependencies.
- Updated `App.tsx` to use `useSetAtom` and `useAtomValue` so unused setters no longer cause type errors.
- Fixed type issues in `Prompt.tsx` by importing `GenerateContentConfig`, updating the configuration object and safely handling the response from `generateContent`.
- Verified the project compiles with `tsc` and builds via Vite.

Remaining tasks for future sessions:
- Implement automated tests and CI workflow.
- Provide example environment configuration and deployment instructions.
