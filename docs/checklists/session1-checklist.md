# Session 1 â€“ Production Release Checklist

The project currently includes TypeScript React code for an AI Studio app with 
multiple UI components. Basic documentation exists but there is no build or deploy workflow defined.

## Current Repository Status
- Source code for the application is present under the root directory.
- `package.json` defines dependencies for React and Vite.
- `package-lock.json` is not committed yet and should be added for reproducible installs.
- Documentation exists in `docs/` but there is no architecture folder or release checklist yet.

## Checklist Toward Production Release
1. **Add missing `package-lock.json` to version control** for consistent dependency management.
2. **Create automated test suite** covering React components and utilities.
3. **Implement CI workflow** (GitHub Actions) to run linting, tests and build on every push.
4. **Set up production build configuration** using Vite and ensure assets are optimized.
5. **Document environment variables** such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env.example` file.
6. **Provide deployment instructions** for the chosen hosting platform (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Vercel).
7. **Ensure accessibility and responsiveness** of the UI across devices.
8. **Review and update licenses and attribution** for any third-party assets used.
9. **Add code ownership and contribution guidelines** (`CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
10. **Create user documentation** including a quickstart and troubleshooting guide.

These tasks should be completed before declaring a production-ready release.
