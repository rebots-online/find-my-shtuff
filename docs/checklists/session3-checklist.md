# Session 3 â€“ Merge Checklist

This session focused on merging the development branch into `master` and documenting the repository state.

## Steps Completed
1. Checked the working tree was clean with `git status`.
2. Fast-forward merged branch `work` into `master`.
3. Verified no conflicts and repository remained functional.
4. Generated architecture snapshots (`session3-before.md` and `session3-after.md`).
5. Documented these steps in this checklist.

## Next Steps
- Continue development on new feature branches as needed.
- Keep architecture diagrams updated whenever structural changes occur.
