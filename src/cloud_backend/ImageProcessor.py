# Placeholder for ImageProcessor.py
# This script/module will be responsible for:
# 1. Being triggered by new image uploads to cloud storage.
# 2. Downloading the image.
# 3. Calling a powerful cloud-based ML model/API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API, AWS Rekognition)
#    for object detection.
# 4. Parsing the results.
# 5. Storing the structured detection data into the ObjectDatabase.

# Example (conceptual):
# def process_image_from_storage(event, context):
#     """Triggered by a change to a Cloud Storage bucket."""
#     file_data = event
#     bucket_name = file_data['bucket']
#     file_name = file_data['name']

#     print(f"Processing file: {file_name} from bucket: {bucket_name}.")

#     # 1. Download image (e.g., from GCS)
#     # image_content = download_blob(bucket_name, file_name)

#     # 2. Call ML API (e.g., Google Vision API)
#     # client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
#     # image = vision.Image(content=image_content)
#     # response = client.object_localization(image=image)
#     # localized_object_annotations = response.localized_object_annotations

#     # 3. Parse results
#     # detected_objects = []
#     # for obj in localized_object_annotations:
#     #     detected_objects.append({
#     #         "name": obj.name,
#     #         "score": obj.score,
#     #         "bounding_poly_normalized": [(v.x, v.y) for v in obj.bounding_poly.normalized_vertices]
#     #     })

#     # 4. Store in ObjectDatabase
#     # from ObjectDatabase import save_detection_results
#     # image_id = file_name # Or some other unique ID
#     # user_id = extract_user_id_from_filename(file_name) # Assuming it's encoded
#     # timestamp = get_timestamp_from_filename(file_name) # Assuming it's encoded
#     # save_detection_results(image_id, user_id, timestamp, detected_objects)

#     print(f"Finished processing {file_name}.")

# def download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name):
#     """Downloads a blob from the bucket."""
#     # ... implementation for downloading from cloud storage ...
#     pass
