# Placeholder for SearchAPI.py
# This module will represent the backend API endpoint(s) for handling search queries from the Android app.
# It would typically be implemented using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI, or as a serverless function
# (e.g., Google Cloud Function, AWS Lambda).

# Responsibilities:
# 1. Define API endpoint(s) for search (e.g., /search).
# 2. Receive search queries (e.g., text, filters) from the Android app.
# 3. Interact with ObjectDatabase.py to perform the search against stored detection data.
# 4. Format and return search results to the app.

# Example (conceptual using Flask-like structure):

# from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
# import ObjectDatabase # Assuming ObjectDatabase.py provides search functions

# app = Flask(__name__)

# @app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
# def search_objects():
#     user_id = request.args.get('userId')
#     query_text = request.args.get('query') # e.g., "chair", "keys"

#     if not user_id or not query_text:
#         return jsonify({"error": "Missing userId or query parameter"}), 400

#     try:
#         # This assumes ObjectDatabase.py has a function like search_objects_by_label
#         # The actual implementation in ObjectDatabase.py would handle the database query logic
#         # based on the text and user_id.
#         results = ObjectDatabase.search_objects_by_label(user_id=user_id, object_label=query_text)

#         # Further processing of results might be needed:
#         # - Augment with full image URLs if not stored directly with object info.
#         # - Paginate results.
#         # - Rank results.

#         return jsonify({"userId": user_id, "query": query_text, "results": results}), 200
#     except Exception as e:
#         # Log the exception e
#         return jsonify({"error": "Search failed due to an internal error"}), 500

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     # This is for local testing; in a cloud environment, a WSGI server like Gunicorn would run the app,
#     # or it would be deployed as a serverless function.
#     # app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
#     pass

# Other considerations for a real SearchAPI:
# - Authentication/Authorization: Ensure only authorized users can search their own data.
# - Input Validation and Sanitization.
# - More sophisticated query parsing (e.g., handling multiple keywords, phrases, filters like date ranges).
# - Error handling and logging.
# - Pagination for results.
# - Potentially integrating with a dedicated search index if simple database queries become too slow or limited.
